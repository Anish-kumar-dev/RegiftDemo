RegiftDemo
==========

Demo of my library Regift, for converting a video to a gif on iOS

This demo has to be run on a device so that you can record a video.

Once you've recorded a video, follow these steps to view the gif on your Mac.

1. In Xcode, click Window → Devices (⌘ + ⇧ + 2)
2. Select your device, then ‘RegiftDemo’ in the ‘Installed Apps’ section
3. Click the cog below the list, then select ‘Download Container’
4. Save the container on the Desktop (or anywhere)
5. Open the container’s containing folder in the Finder
6. Right click the container, and select ‘Show Package Contents’
7. Your gif is located under App Data → tmp → regift.gif

If there are any issues or suggestions, please contact me via the [main Regift repository](https://github.com/matthewpalmer/Regift).
